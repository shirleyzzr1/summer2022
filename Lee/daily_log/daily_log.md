***Note. Assuming your Jetson developer kit has been flashed with and is running L4T 32.3.1 or higher.***  
1. ```sudo apt update```
2. ```sudo apt install nvidia-jetpack```  
3. ```sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit```  
4. ```sudo apt show nvidia-jetpack```  
5. ```cat /usr/local/cuda/version.txt```  

Current Jetson NAno version: JetPack 4.6 that includes 10.2 CUDA, ref: https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/jetpack/install-jetpack/index.html 
 
Things to do:

- [x] Had a meeting with Joe & Francisco: https://github.com/waggle-sensor/node-platforms/tree/main/nvidia-nano (IT WAS VERY USEFUL, AWESOME!!!!!)
- [x] Attend the Demo meeting; Joe, Neal, Sergey, ismael and Sammi to understand the overall plan (e.g., discussion of testing the VSN beepkeeper change in a VM style space)

Things to do:
- [ ] It seems like ROS depends on other modules such as python version, and need to conduct more research into the singularity dependency & docker to run ROS - I will ask the question when Sean comes back to Argonne from his vacation.
- [ ] Checking Jetson Nano software updater; the package system is broken because of using third party repositories.
- [ ] Reading the Ansible documents to implement our node system.

----------------------------------------------
### Week 4: 6/20 to 6/24 ###
#### Monday June 20th ####
- [x] Report to Raj and Pete: The current Jetson Nano version is JetPack 4.6 which includes 10.2 CUDA. While installing several packages such as Jetpack 4.6 for Nano on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, it shows the unmet dependencies issue, including to the python-rosdep-moduels do not match. Setting up for ROS in a Singularity container as singularity can be an option to solve it out and Docker container can be used to run a container inside the container, however, it also shows the mismatch of the dependencies; Plus, it shows the another mismatch issue such as minikube_1.16.0-0_amd64.deb: package architecture (arm64) does not match system (amd64) as those architectures are not same. The next step in order to get over these issues, the list of dependencies for ROS is required.

Things to do:  
- [ ] Debugged the dependency and listed up the required for Nano

#### Tuesday June 21th ####
- [x] Had a meeting with Joe and Francisco: https://github.com/waggle-sensor/node-platforms/tree/main/nvidia-nano

#### Wednesday June 22th ####

- [ ] Install ROS GUI

#### Thursday June 23th ####
- [x] Had a meeting with Pete, Raj, Joe to discuss about Jetson Nano Kit plan
- [x] Got ssh access for Nano 
- [x] Had a meeting with Sean and Yomi; discussion docker container & architecture

#### Friday June 24th ####
- [x] Read up ROS documents
- [x] Debugging ROS dockerfile 

Things to do:

If the command line ```curl -sS https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3.10 (e.g.)``` runs, it will show the moduleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils.cmd' for example.  
```sudo apt update```  
```alias python='/usr/bin/python3.6```  
```sudo update-alternatives --config python3```  
```python -m pip install --upgrade pip```

Linux(Waggle) should know about the itemized list such as different types of sensors 
 
#### Friday July 8th ####
- [x] Had a meeting with Joe to talk about Ansible script
- Configuration on MAC

- From user side

(1) Ensuring ```pip``` is available on your computer and install ansible  
```pip --version```  //pip 21.3.1 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pip (python 3.9)

```pip3 install --upgrade pip``` //if you do not have

```pip3 install ansible``` // For linux, it is avilable here: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html

(2) Test on your own machine with hello-world file. Create your own directoy first (e.g., ansible): https://github.com/waggle-sensor/node-platforms/blob/main/nvidia-nano/01_ansible_nvidia-nano_base.yaml 

```cd ansible```

```cd node-platforms/```

```cd nvidia-nano```

```ansible-playbook -i ansible_inventory 01_ansible_nvidia-nano_base.yaml //error will occur if it is your own host```

```ansible-playbook -i ansible_inventory --user root 01_ansible_nvidia-nano_base.yaml //should work as "--user" included```

----------------------------------------------
### Week 8: 7/18 to 7/22 ###
#### Monday July 18th
- [x] Prepared meeting with Robotic teams,

#### Tuesday July 19th
- [x] Had a meeting with Doga. Summary:
1. Which one is the Default machine mainly used (I can ask to Rory directly)
2. Pipespipes configuration be careful with channels 8/single (attached figures)
3. Is there any other repo so that I can use it as a reference except this (https://github.com/AD-SDL/ot2_driver)? Yes, for scheduler: https://github.com/AD-SDL/workcell_manager, or more details: https://github.com/AD-SDL/ot2_workcell
4. OT-2 supports http? Yes, also any message socket will be operated (such as MQ messaging protocol. zeroMQ socket, client, server configuration, already installed on RPI for OT-2)
5. Scheduler is not just designed to communicate with OT-2, they are able to communicate with other robots they have.
6. Diagram explanation -ROS master (ross master, scheduler…. )
	- Data is stored in the MySQL (Unique id, Type, Protocol_file (binary to normal text). Currently, it is an early step, and these parameters would be changed according to the future goals.
	- Username is just a root, IP is a robot IP, port number must be the same as the server side, such as 8085 for example, * (accept any IP address), Stdout (it means that it will return output message (protocol execute)
	- To run his code uploaded on the GitHub, of course it is always first to execute listener (server) first. Otherwise, the connection won’t be established.
	- The second one is an any small computer. He uses his RPI for testing, but it would be running via Jetson Nano. As long as it is Ubuntu based (like 18.04 or above version, it works.
 7.  SSH setup: https://support.opentrons.com/s/article/Setting-up-SSH-access-to-your-OT-2
Conda
```Pip3 install zmq``` Python3 is required, not Python2
```Ssh key of course important```
```git clone https://github.com/AD-SDL/ot2_driver```
```pip install -e .```
My personal note: Need to conduct research, protocol_handler, library module name paramiko (implementation of the SSHv2 protocol), SCPClient (scp protocol file to the robot, zeroMQ to let robot run the script and send the status back to master. Scheduler decide which OT2 to run the protocol, RPL datebase, keep track of protocol. Master send protocol file to database. External rosnode scp file to OT2, get protocol file from database. OT2 listener wait until protocol compelete it, and send message back to rosnode. (follow the chart on github)
Set up ssh and save it inside opentron different type of ssh key https://support.opentrons.com/s/article/Setting-up-SSH-access-to-your-OT-2
Thing to do by next week:
	- If we have a question we can ask Rory or Kyle. They work on the way how to control robots depends on the last week meetings. Opentrons not currently using ROS directly
- In general, networking connection and remote access were discussed this week. Next Wednesday (27th) around 10:30AM, we will talk about ROS (workflow.json file)
