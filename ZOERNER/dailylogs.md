- Began to select radar images that would provide good data for image processing (different shapes)
- Pre-processed images to binary with thresholding with all pixels below 100 are set to 0 (black) and all pixels above 100 are set to 255 (white) to assist further with eliminating radar noise. Unsure if this is a proper method.

#### Week 6 Overview and Reflection

---

I am over halfway through my SULI internship at this point in time, with 4 weeks left. My poster submission is due in 2 weeks, on July 21st.</br>
So far, I have gathered a data set, created a binary image and removed radar noise, and computed some parameters for the radar image.</br>
</br>
My next steps are to export these computations into a text file and format the file, perform k-means clustering on the parameters, and make revisions. Additionally, I need to increase the scale at which my current algorithm operates by looping through a dataset of multiple images and performing the analysis for all of the images in the dataset.  </br>
</br>
If time allows, I can either gather more datasets that I believe would make good cases to analyze, or run this algorithm for an entire season.</br>
</br>
The Learning on the Lawn event is on August 4th, and my final paper is due on August 5th. I will also need to complete a peer review by the end of my internship.</br>
</br>
I have learned so much about the research process throughout my internship at ANL so far. I have met some wonderful people here and have made amazing connections with my collegues. My project has been challenging and enriching for me, as I have had to take a lot of time to learn about new processes and techniques that were previously unfamiliar to me.</br>
</br>
My mentor, Bhupendra, gave me great advice. He told me that research is like learning how to ride a bike, you have to fall down before you can figure it out. I definitely needed to hear that!
