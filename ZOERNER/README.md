### Welcome!

This repository outlines the work of Maggie Zoerner, a Student Undergraduate Laboratory Intern at Argonne National Laboratory in the Environmental Science Division. I am also an undergraduate meteorology student at Iowa State University. This work was completed as part of my research appointment in the summer of 2022. </br>
The goal of this proect is to develop a method to perform the automated analysis of storm morphology in radar data. </br>
Common packages include NumPy, matplotlib, Py-ART, OpenCV, and scikit-learn.

The scripts written for this project can be found within "code". My presentations and paper can be found under "deliverables".
