# Daily Progress Report

### Project Goals ###

- [ ] Create workflow and documentation (in the waggle github) to run instrumented AI@Edge in a docker.  Demo how to do it for the whole team.
- [ ] Decide on 5 simple measurements, by default, for all computational tasks.  For example: GPU RAM max, CPU RAM max, average, etc.
- [ ] Add into workflow pywaggle hooks to report summary measurements for each job to beehive.
- [ ] Add in pywaggle bits to publish internally, periodically, to scoreboard, so resource managers running locally could decide how to tune or tweak a running container that was misbehaving or exceeding resources.
